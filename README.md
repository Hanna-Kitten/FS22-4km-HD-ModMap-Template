# To do (future versions)
- package the files as a mod so that replacing the mapUS is no longer needed.
- make all placeables, terrain edits and terraforming free 
- add all the 3D assets from all 3 base maps as placeables from the shop menu.
- create a shop menu better suited for map creation
- create a toggleable grid on the ground to show tile widths???
- create script or tool to export world save as a mod map???
- create script for different game modes???
- include store dependancies for good asset packs???
- implement in-game infoLayer editing UI, for editing farmlands and AI collisions???



# Known issues
- The editor is laggy when in paint mode. This is an issue with the editor with 8192x8192 weight files. Don't worry. This doesn't happen in game
- The loading screen in game takes a liitle longer. This only happens the first time you run it.
- The first 20 seconds of game play (after the loading screen) may stutter. Give everything time to load in and this issue goes away.
