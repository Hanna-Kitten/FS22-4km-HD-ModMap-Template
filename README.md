# Known issues
- The editor is laggy when in paint mode. This is an issue with the editor with 8192x8192 weight files. Don't worry. This doesn't happen in game
- The loading screen in game takes a liitle longer. This only happens the first time you run it.
- The first 20 seconds of game play (after the loading screen) may stutter. Give everything time to load in and this issue goes away.
